    /*
     * Note that the constructor is apparently never called, but there are no null
     * pointer exceptions regarding that libraryApp is not set. When creating the
     * BookSteps object, the Cucumber libraries are using that constructor with an
     * object of class LibraryApp as the default.
     *
     * This also holds for all other step classes that have a similar constructor.
     * In this case, the <b>same</b> object of class LibraryApp is used as an
     * argument. This provides an easy way of sharing the same object, in this case
     * the object of class LibraryApp and the errorMessage Holder, among all step classes.
     *
     * This principle is called <em>dependency injection</em>. More information can
     * be found in the "Cucumber for Java" book available online from the DTU Library.
